# Custom config for NvChad's Neovim
Custom configuration to extend and improve NvChad's config.

What to do:
1. Link the ./custom folder to the NvChad files
2. Run :PackerCompile
    - Must be run everytime you change the plugin configuration
3. Run :MasonInstallAll
    - Installs all the LSPs (language server protocols) which are setup in the config files (mostly for web dev)
